# inventoryScan
This is a powershell script that will scan a windows domain and get you information about the PC's that are currently turned on. 

I originally made this in order to find computers that still had HDD's or old CPU's so we could plan to replace them. 

It runs in a windows domain and will enable WinRM via powershell.
